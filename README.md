## [Try it here](https://damdoy.github.io/procedural_2d_landscape/procedural_landscape.html)

Procedural generation of a landscape with forests and mountains in javascript only using basic shapes (circles, triangles, lines).

The goal is to make it look like a painting, by drawing far away features first.

This is only a toy example of what can be do with simple shapes, its performance is pretty bad, if it had to be done correctly,
it should be done with webgl and shaders.
